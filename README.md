NYC SHSAT Exam: Which Schools need help?
The Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHSAT) is the only criterion for admissions to 8 of the 9 New York City Specialized High Schools. The only exception is the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, which requires an audition or portfolio for admission.

The SHSAT is administered by the New York City Department of Education and is only available to New York City residents in the 8th/9th grade. In 2016, approximately 28,000+ students took the SHSAT, and less than 20% of those students were accepted to a New York City Specialized High School.

What are we trying to achieve from this app?
Our agenda is to figure out NYC schools that need help so that their 8th graders can perform better in SHSAT. We would analyze what are the contributing factors that could lead to success/failure. Through this app user can gain insights based on data and derive conclusions to which schools need help to perform better.

This app could specifically benefit Nonprofit organizations like PASSNYC, HELICON ,Inc. who strive to identify talented underserved students within New York City's underperforming school districts in order to increase the diversity of students taking the SHSAT. These organizations provide free educational opportunities to underserved students to help them prepare better and score a spot in Elite High School
